An Ex Libris Cloud App alternative to Alma's built-in print slip report.

This an attempt to make an Cloud App solution for the idea to [allow configuration of which columns are in the the Print Slip Report](https://ideas.exlibrisgroup.com/forums/308173-alma/suggestions/12375144-allow-configuration-of-which-columns-are-in-the-th) that was posted on Idea Exchange.

This app was developed as part of the [ANZREG](https://anzreg.igelu.org/) 2021 Cloud Apps hackathon.

## Note on the origin of this cloudapp

The code of this Cloudapp has been transferred to this repository in consultation with the original developers. The original code comes from the following repository: https://github.com/SydneyUniLibrary/print-slip-report
Further development and maintenance will happen in this repository.

## Help

### Troubleshooting
**I don't see the Cloud App Center icon**<br>
Cloud Apps have not been enabled for your Alma. Contact your Alma administrator to have Cloud Apps enabled.

**I don't find Print Slip Report under Installed Apps.**<br>
Install the app by following the steps under the heading "Getting started".

**I don't find Print Slip Report when I search for it**<br>
Your Alma administrator has selected which apps are available to you. Contact your Alma administrator to have the Print Slip Report app made available in your Alma.

**The popup window disappears and I see a message about not being authorised.**<br>
Your Alma user needs a circulation desk operator role. Contact your Alma administrator about your Alma roles.

Currently having just a requests operator role doesn't work. This is will be fixed in the June release of Alma.

**The popup window disappears and I see a message about valid library codes.**<br>
If you entered the name of your library, you need to enter its code instead. The message has the codes your libraries. If you don't know which code to use, contact your Alma administrator.

**The popup window disappears and I see a message about valid circulation desk codes.**<br>
If you entered the name of the circulation desk, you need to enter its code instead. The message has the codes for the circulation desks at your library. If you don't know which code to use, contact your Alma administrator.

**Requests I've already printed and appearing again**<br>
The app doesn't mark requests as having been printed. Alma will remove them from the print when the request is actioned or marked missing.

**I used the facets and selections to the Pick Up Requested Resources screen, but all the requests printed**<br>
The app doesn't use the Pick Up Requested Resource screen. It always prints all of the requested resources that need to be picked up for the your library and circulation desk.

**Not all of the column I selected are in the print**<br>
You selected too many columns to fit on the page. Try printing in landscape instead of portrait, or select fewer columns.
